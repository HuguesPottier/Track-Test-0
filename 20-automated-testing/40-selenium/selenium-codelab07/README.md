# Testing stories

In this codelab we're going to write automated tests for digibooky.

## Task list

Write automated tests for the following stories:
1. Story 11: Lending a book
2. Story 12: Return a book
3. Story 21: Lending history

Don't just write a test for the happy path of the stories.
Think of scenario's that things might go wrong.

You can find some documentation [here](https://github.com/switchfully/track-shared/tree/master/60-projects/10-digibooky) or [here](https://archive.switchfully.com/track/test/digibooky/stories)
