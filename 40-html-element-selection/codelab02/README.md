# HTML Selecting based on CSS Selectors

The goal of this codelab is to learn how to select elements with css selectors

## Context
CSS selectors have some advantages compared to id selecting.

With CSS selectors you can:
- select based on id
- select based on tag-name
- select based on css class name
- select children of a selection by combining two selections together
- ...

How does this work?
- `#<id>` to select based on id
- `<tag>` to select based on tag name
- `.<class>` to select based on css class
- `<selection1> > <selection2>` will select all elements that are selected by selection2 and that have a direct parent that is selected by selection1

All css selectors can return multiple results.

Some examples :
- `#css-query` will select all elements with id `css-query`
- `div` will select all `<div>` elements
- `.header` will select all elements with `class='header'`
- `ul > li` will select all `<li>` elements that have an `<ul>` element as a direct parent

### How to select an element?

Your browser can construct a selector for you:
1. Right-click the element you want to select
2. Select inspect
3. The developer tool will open
4. Right-click the tag in the developer tools
5. Choose `Copy` -> `Copy selector` ![copy selector](copy-selector.png)
6. You have a css selector for the element!

Be careful! While the browser will create a valid selector for you, it is always good to check that the selector makes sense.
Also, using this method you can only select one element at a time. Sometimes you'll need to select multiple elements.

How to select multiple elements?
1. Learn the css selector syntax
2. Construct a selector manually with your knowledge of the webpage
