# Working in a team

This codelab can be seen as a little project you'll work on as a team.
The goal is to work together to make sure as much of the application is automatically tested.

## Assignment
You can find a list of all feature of the digibooky website here [here](https://github.com/switchfully/track-shared/tree/master/60-projects/10-digibooky) or [here](https://archive.switchfully.com/track/test/digibooky/stories).
The task of your team is to automatically test as much as possible.

Think about the following:
1. What are the more important features to test?
2. Which edge cases will you test for each feature? How many scenarios do you need?
3. How will you work efficiently together? You'll need rules, so you don't do the same things twice (like creating the same Page class multiple times)
4. Think about the step definitions you'll make. These definitions will be used to describe your scenarios, so make sure the language feels good.

A good setup is everything. It's okay to go slow in the beginning. You'll start to go faster once you'll have more classes (Steps, Pages)

Good luck!
